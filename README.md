In Vim, (optionally) select some text and then press `:MarkdownPreview` and see the rendered results in a browser.

Useful when writing long-form text in Markdown but ultimately want to (1) send the rendered content in a rich email or (2) post to a blog in HTML format, etc.

Needs [multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) to be installed.
